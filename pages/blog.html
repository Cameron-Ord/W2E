                    <p>Douglas Lee Williams (born August 9, 1955) is an American football executive and former
                        quarterback and
                        coach. Williams
                        is best known <br>for his performance with the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII against
                        the Denver
                        Broncos, where he
                        was named Super Bowl<br> MVP after passing for 340 yards and four touchdowns, a single-quarter
                        Super
                        Bowl record which he
                        set in the second quarter, making him<br> the first black quarterback to both start and win a
                        Super
                        Bowl.</p>

                    <p>The Battle of Gembloux took place at Gembloux, near Namur, Low Countries, between the Spanish
                        forces led
                        by Don
                        John of Austria (Spanish: Don Juan de Austria),<br> Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands,
                        and a
                        rebel army
                        composed of Dutch, Flemish, English, Scottish, German, French, and Walloon soldiers under
                        Antoine<br> de
                        Goignies, during the Eighty Years' War. On 31 January 1578 the Spanish cavalry commanded by
                        John's
                        nephew, Don Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma (Italian:<br> Alessandro Farnese, Spanish:
                        Alejandro
                        Farnesio), after
                        pushing back the Netherlandish cavalry, attacked the Netherlandish army, causing an enormous
                        panic
                        amongst<br> the
                        rebel troops. The result was a crushing victory for the Spanish forces. The battle hastened the
                        disintegration of the unity of the rebel provinces, and meant the end<br> of the Union of
                        Brussels.</p>
